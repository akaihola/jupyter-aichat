## Talking to the chatbot
Click on a cell and type either
>```python
>[1]: %ai "your message"
>```

or

>```python
>[2]: %%ai
>      your message
>      which may contain multiple lines
>```

and type `Shift-Enter`.

## More information
- `%ai /commands` â€“ list additional commands
- `%ai "your question about jupyter-aichat"` â€“ I've now been primed with basic information about `jupyter-aichat`,
  and you can just ask, and I'll try to answer. Make me forget all of that with `%ai /restart`.
